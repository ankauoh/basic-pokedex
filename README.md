Description: This project is a simple pokedex to get into the basics of javascript.

This project accesses the pokeapi pokedex, and calls the information for each pokemon.

The aim was to leanr the broad idea and functioning of javascript, but emphasizing the supplemental streamlining resources to make the project run smoothly and using industry standards

This included the addition of polyfills, the use of jquery syntax, and finally using bootstrap styling. The end result is a minimal html file, a barebones supplemental css file and a more fleshed out js file, which makes use of the inherent classes in bootstrap, in combination with the function-first programming methods learned throughout the exercise. All of this is within an IIFE

The end result is a very basic, but functional grid of pokemon blocks, which open modals that include their info.
